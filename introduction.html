		<ul>
			<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am originally from Virginia and will always call it home, even though I have been in North Carolina for more than 20 years now.  I also took a detour to Texas for a few years and I miss that state.  I have two kids, who are absolutely awesome!  I love being outdoors, and am always up for an adventure.</li>
			<li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I currently have two jobs, both of which are working for non-profits.  The US one I am the HR rep, the executive administrator, as well as anything else they throw my way.  My other job I am the CEO that helps people in India.  (Ask me about it, I LOVE to talk about India.)</li>
			<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> Long and varied with a huge break in between the academic four walls.  I attended college in NC, learned telecommunications and worked in that for many years, before jumping into homeschooling (which means relearning everything for a second and third time), and I am now back to school to learn more about my COVID interest.</li>
			<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 10</li>
			<li><strong>Courses I'm Taking, and Why:</strong>
				<ol type="i">
					<li><strong>CTI 110 - </strong>Required for the degree I want.</li>
					<li><strong>CTI 120 - </strong>Required for the degree I want.</li>
					<li><strong>CTI 130 - </strong>Required for the degree I want.</li>
					<li><strong>WEB 110 - </strong>Because I heard this one has the best instructor ever! <em>(And also required for the degree I want.)</em></li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Something to Remember Me By:</strong> I believe that learning doesn't just happen in the classroom, but sometimes you need that too.</li>
